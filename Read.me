what market indiactors does it provide?
    •	Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)
        •	Forward P/E: Divides the S&P 500’s price by the aggregate earnings per share (EPS) forecasted for the next 12 months.
        •	Trailing P/E: Divides the S&P 500’s price by the past 12 months’ aggregate EPS.
        •	Compare to Historical Averages: Compare the current P/E ratio to its long-term historical average (typically around 16-18 for the S&P 500).
            •	Higher than average: May indicate overvaluation.
            •	Lower than average: May suggest undervaluation.

	•	Shiller CAPE Ratio (Cyclically Adjusted P/E)
        •	Adjusts earnings over a 10-year period for inflation.
        •	Reduces the impact of short-term earnings volatility.
        •	Compare the CAPE ratio to its historical mean (about 15-16). A significantly higher CAPE may signal overvaluation.

	•	Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S)
	    •	Divides the aggregate market capitalization of the S&P 500 by its total revenue.
	    •	A rising P/S ratio without commensurate revenue growth may indicate overvaluation.

	•	Dividend Yield
        •	Compare the S&P 500’s current dividend yield to its historical average (typically around 2%).
        •	A lower-than-average dividend yield could suggest overvaluation.

	•	Earnings Growth Projections
        •	Assess the market’s growth assumptions using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model or other valuation models.
        •	Compare expected earnings growth to historical GDP growth rates and inflation trends.

	•	Tobin’s Q
        •	Compares the market value of equities to the replacement cost of corporate assets.
        •	A ratio above 1 may suggest overvaluation.

	•	S&P 500 Yield vs. Bond Yield
        •	Compare the S&P 500 earnings yield (inverse of P/E ratio) to yields on benchmark Treasury bonds.
        •	If the equity earnings yield is close to or below bond yields, equities might be overvalued.

	•	Sentiment Indicators
	    •	Assess market sentiment through indicators like the Volatility Index (VIX), which reflects investor risk appetite.
        •	Excessive bullish sentiment could indicate overvaluation.
